        <p>The man was born in 1979, 10 years later after the great war of 69s. Born in such a time where people still fight each other for glory, he stood up to be the man of the people and said: "we must kill all of those who dares to stand up against us" and lead the people to glory.</p>
        <h3 id="era">Era</h3>
        <p>The word era also denotes the units used under a different, more arbitrary system where time is not represented as an endless continuum with a single reference year, but each unit starts counting from one again as if time starts again.</p>
